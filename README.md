# Intelligent Cloud Cost Governance

An end-to-end **cloud cost governance system** that correlates **real-time AWS usage metrics** with **billing data** to generate **cost optimization recommendations and future cost forecasts**.

This project demonstrates how cloud resource usage (starting with Amazon EC2) can be analyzed intelligently to identify waste, improve efficiency, and reduce unnecessary cloud spend.

> **Phase-1 Scope:**  
> This implementation is validated using **Amazon EC2**.  
> The architecture is **service-agnostic** and designed to support additional cloud resources (S3, RDS, etc.) in future phases.

## 📌 Why This Project Exists (Problem Statement)

In real-world cloud environments, organizations often waste **20–30% of their cloud budget** due to:
- Underutilized compute resources
- Lack of visibility between usage and cost
- Reactive (post-spend) cost analysis
- Limited actionable recommendations

Existing tools mostly show **what was spent**, not **why it was spent** or **what should be done next**.

This project addresses that gap by:
- Collecting **actual usage metrics**
- Mapping them to **actual billing data**
- Generating **governance recommendations**
- Predicting **future costs**
- Presenting everything in a **single dashboard**

## 🧠 What This Project Does (High-Level)

1. Monitors real cloud resource usage (CPU, runtime, state)
2. Retrieves real AWS billing data
3. Correlates usage with cost
4. Identifies inefficiencies
5. Generates recommendations
6. Forecasts future cost
7. Displays insights via a web dashboard
